    <h2>The Web and Encryption</h2>

    <p>
        Over the last 25 years, the Web has grown into a platform for much of the world’s
        communication, whether it be information sharing, community building, commerce, education,
        social networking, or underpinning applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        In meeting these needs, the Web’s trustworthiness has become critical to its success. If a
        person cannot trust that they are communicating with the party they intend, they can’t use
        the Web to shop safety; if they cannot be assured that Web-delivered news isn’t modified in
        transit, they won’t trust it as much. If someone cannot be assured that they’re talking
        only to the intended recipients, they might avoid social networking.
    </p>
    <p>
        These important properties of authentication, integrity and confidentiality are best — if
        imperfectly — provided on the Web by Transport Layer Security (TLS) [[RFC5246]]. For HTTP
        URLs, this means using HTTPS instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the past, Web sites have deployed HTTPS rarely; often, only when financial transactions
        take place. More recently, however, it has become apparent that nearly all activity on the
        Web can be considered sensitive, since it now plays such a central role in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, security on the Web has proven to be quite subtle. If an attacker can modify
        content in transit, the power of the Web platform we are defining can easily be turned
        against the user (or the site they are using). If a request for something as simple as an
        image is sent in the clear, an attacker can infer what the user is doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, attacks like Pervasive Monitoring [[RFC7258]] only increase the urgency and
        relevance of establishing a basis for trust on the entire Web.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the TAG finds that the Web platform should be designed to <strong>actively
        prefer secure origins</strong> — typically, by encouraging use of HTTPS URLs instead of
        HTTP ones. Furthermore, the <strong>end-to-end nature of TLS encryption must not be
        compromised</strong> on the Web, in order to preserve this trust.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recognize that HTTPS will not solve all — or even many — security problems in the Web
        platform. However, it does serve as an important and necessary baseline for further
        developments. This is especially true as the platform becomes more powerful, and thus more
        dangerous to use “in the clear”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Likewise, we realize that transitioning to HTTPS may not be easy for all sites. While the
        CPU overhead of TLS has been largely overcome by advances in processor technology, the Web
        platform itself makes changing schemes difficult, both because URLs themselves need to
        change, and because the URL scheme is also used to trigger different behavior in many
        platform features. These problems ought to be viewed as opportunities for improvement in
        the platform, rather than reasons to stop adoption of encryption.
    </p>
    <p>
        We acknowledge that in some cases, networks currently rely upon cleartext access to network
        flows to impose policy (e.g., filtering) and optimize content. However, we believe that
        policy imposition is best performed at the endpoints of a connection (although we
        acknowledge that more work needs to be done to facilitate this, from both ends).
        Furthermore, providing network-based optimization is not a valid reason to violate trust on
        the Web, and should be made unnecessary in the medium-to-long term by other improvements in
        the Web platform (see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2010/webperf/">Web Performance Working
        Group</a>, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, some have expressed fear that an encrypted Web will benefit those with purposes
        that are distasteful or even dangerous. We reject these arguments; the Web is a tool that
        can be used to many ends, and possible misuse does not imply that the tool should be so
        limited as to not fit its purpose.
    </p>

    <h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

    <p>
        Actively preferring secure origins has a number of implications for Web specifications; the
        most immediate is that new, "powerful" features</strong> should be specified to either
        require them, or give them preferential treatment. The <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Applications Security Working Group</a> has
        begun work on [[powerful-features]] to fully specify this, along with how existing
        specifications should be handled. The TAG will work with WebAppSec to develop this
        document.
    </p>
    <p>
        Simultaneously, reducing the costs of switching to and using HTTPS should be a continuing
        area of focus for the W3C. In particular, features that change behavior based upon the URL
        scheme ("http" to "https") should be examined to see if these differences can either be
        eliminated or controlled by authors, providing that there is no loss of security or
        surprising changes in behavior. For example, the [[referrer-policy]] specification is
        offering more control over the Referer HTTP header, as part of [[CSP2]]. The TAG encourages
        work to identify similar areas of friction and potential mitigations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another source of friction is deploying HTTPS in some networks; for example, in private
        network address ranges [[RFC1918]]. The TAG encourages work in this area, while
        acknowledging that the W3C is not necessarily the best venue for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Increasing the trustworthiness of the PKI system (on which HTTPS is currently dependent) is
        also of interest; we are tracking efforts like <a
        href="http://www.certificate-transparency.org">Certificate Transparency</a> [[RFC6962]] in
        the IETF, and will encourage activity within the W3C when appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
        We note the continued deployment of so-called “split browsers,”  which automatically proxy
        and transform traffic, sometimes including HTTPS traffic, as well as the continuing
        practice of inserting new Certificate Authorities into a user's trust store without
        informing them of the power this grants. While both have legitimate uses, the implications
        for trust on the Web should be examined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, imposing policy in endpoints implies creation of a browser API for doing so. The
        TAG encourages work in this area, provided there is a good chance of implementation and a
        reasonable outcome.
